Sass is a CSS pre-processor, that adds power and elegance to the basic language.

Sass source code -> Sass Compiler -> Compiled CSS code.

- Variables: for reusuable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc. 
- Nesting: to nest selectors inside of one another allowing us to write less code.
- Operators: for math operations right inside of CSS
- Partials and imports: to write CSS in diferrent files and importing them all into one single file
- Mixins: to write reusable pieces of CSS code
- Functions: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can be used
- Extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them
- Control directives: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops
